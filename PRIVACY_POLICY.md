## MightyMarks Kids: Privacy policy

Welcome to the MightyMarks Kids app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Stephen Phillips for our MightyMarks club at
Landmark Baptist Church. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is
also available on Google Play.

Seeing we are trying to teach our kids to be safe and use the Internet wisely, I take privacy
very seriously.  I plan to do my best to make this an app that helps the kids and does not cause
any concerns.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data
(app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by you is stored on your device only,
and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.  At some point, I may add
the ability to save progress on the cloud only for our club members.  I will update this privacy
policy at that point in time.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any
question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will
surely try to fix it/help you.

Thanks,

Stephen Phillips.
Plant City, Florida.
