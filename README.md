# MightyMarks Kids

An app to engage our kids in MightyMarks at Landmark Baptist Church.

Currently, the app allows you to select which verse you are trying to memorize.  To build the verse,
you must drag the words in order to the verse area.

## Acessing the App

The web version is currently hosted on the DigitalEagle website.  You can access that here:
[MightyMarks Kids Web](https://digitaleagle.net/mightymarks/)

I am in the process of getting it published on Google Play.


## Contributing

I am using Android Studio and Flutter to build this app.  I will work on getting some instructions
put together for building and changing it.
